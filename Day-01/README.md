## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 1. What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems—including hardware, software, and data—from cyberattacks.  
It aims to ensure:

- **Confidentiality** – keeping data private
- **Integrity** – ensuring data is accurate and unaltered
- **Availability** – making sure services/data are accessible when needed

### 2. Three Types of Teams in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity operations often involve three specialized teams:

---

## 🔴 Red Team – *The Ethical Attackers*

### 🧩 Description:
The Red Team simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify weaknesses in systems, networks, and people. Their main goal is to *think like a hacker* to help improve an organization’s defenses.

### 📘 Example Scenario:
A Red Team launches a phishing campaign to trick employees into revealing login credentials. They then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to internal systems.

### 🛠️ Skills Required:
- Penetration testing
- Social engineering
- Exploit development
- Network scanning & reconnaissance
- Programming/scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell)

### 🧠 Tools Used:
- Metasploit
- Nmap
- Burp Suite
- Wireshark
- Cobalt Strike

---

## 🔵 Blue Team – *The Defenders*

### 🧩 Description:
The Blue Team is responsible for defending the organization’s digital assets. They monitor networks, detect intrusions, and respond to incidents to protect against real attacks.

### 📘 Example Scenario:
After detecting suspicious login attempts from unusual IP addresses, the Blue Team analyzes logs, blocks access, and initiates an incident response plan.

### 🛠️ Skills Required:
- Network monitoring and analysis
- Threat detection and incident response
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- Malware analysis
- Firewall and endpoint protection configuration

### 🧠 Tools Used:
- Splunk / ELK Stack
- Wireshark
- OSSEC
- CrowdStrike
- Snort

---

## 🟣 Purple Team – *The Collaborators*

### 🧩 Description:
The Purple Team facilitates better coordination between the Red and Blue Teams. They use insights from both sides to improve detection, response, and defense capabilities.

### 📘 Example Scenario:
After a Red Team test bypasses an intrusion detection system, the Purple Team works with the Blue Team to fine-tune rules and prevent similar bypasses in the future.

### 🛠️ Skills Required:
- Knowledge of offensive and defensive techniques
- Communication and collaboration
- Threat emulation and detection tuning
- Cyber threat intelligence
- Security controls testing

### 🧠 Tools Used:
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Atomic Red Team
- Velociraptor
- Sigma Rules
- Custom scripts and simulators

## 📝 Homework

1. Research a real-world cyber attack (e.g., Equifax breach, WannaCry, SolarWinds).
   - Identify how a Red Team might have simulated it.
   - Explain how a Blue Team would respond.
   - Suggest how a Purple Team could improve future defenses.

2. Reflect on which team you’d be most interested in joining and why.
